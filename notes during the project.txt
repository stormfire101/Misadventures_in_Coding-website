So learning html itself wasent that hard and neither was css so far.. at least of 9/28/2017 how ever at this point it is likely just going to be a question of
running out and learning the things I will need for specific elemants for the website
	this is similar yet rather different to how I took on the game from last year, if there was a feature I needed to add I focused on leanring the peices for that and slowly made my way through the language and environment
as was always true the key to everything is finding recsourses to learn and work off of
The interesting thing at this point is designing the look and graphics of the website in both ui theme structure and color choice
	the brainstorming proccess I used for my current plan was rather simple
		Ideas: know I could tell what the basic requirements for a site like this would be but I wanted to make the design interesting but was short on ideas so I turned to some of my favorite websites to see if there were any graphical elemants that might work with my project
			the sites that came to mind were
				Think Geek
				Wait but Why
				w3schools
				destiny 2's site (why was it delayed till oct 24)
			I then needed to decide which elemants I liked and decide whether it would fit with what my site is
			 I decided on using the structure of w3schools which I had also seen in documentation for coding languages
